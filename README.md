The net.tqft.toolkit provides a number of utility classes for working in Scala.

Things are a bit disorganized at present, but you may find the following of interest:

* **net.tqft.toolkit.arithmetic.ecm.Factor** employs the elliptic curve method to factor large numbers (faster than Mathematica!)
* **net.tqft.toolkit.algebra.Matrix** provides a basic linear algebra operation, including parallelizable row reduction over arbitrary fields.
